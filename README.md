#  Parcel Delivery Optimization using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This project optimizes parcel delivery routes using Deep Q-learning. 

## Features

-  **Realistic delivery environment** using OSM road network and delivery data  
-  **Trained DQN agent** to optimize routes and delivery timing  
-  **Evaluation and visualization** of agent performance  
-  **Map-based route plotting** with delivery points and depot
